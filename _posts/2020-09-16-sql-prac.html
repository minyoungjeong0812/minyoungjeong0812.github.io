<p>Table: Actions</p>
<pre class="example">
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| post_id       | int     |
| action_date   | date    | 
| action        | enum    |
| extra         | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The action column is an ENUM type of ('view', 'like', 'reaction', 'comment', 'report', 'share').
The extra column has optional information about the action such as a reason for report or a type of reaction. 
</pre>
<p>Write an SQL query that reports the number of posts reported yesterday for each report reason. Assume today is 2019-07-05.</p>
<p>The query result format is in the following example:</p>
<pre class="example">
Actions table:
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | share  | null   |
| 2       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 2       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | view   | null   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-04  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
</pre>
<pre class="example">
Result table:
+---------------+--------------+
| report_reason | report_count |
+---------------+--------------+
| spam          | 1            |
| racism        | 2            |

<p>Note that we only care about report reasons with non zero number of reports.</p>

  <b> My solution <br>
  <a href="https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/qWk5gjBYeTxo5a9jtuUFhc/0">Db-fiddle for this problem</a> <br> </b> </p>
 <p> 
  <p style="color:yellow;"> The key thing to catch is that the initial group by results in two 'racist' posts with the post_id 2 and 5. 
    So we need to perform group by on the extra feature one more time. </p>
  
select temp.extra as report_reason, count(temp.extra) as report_count <br>
from (select extra <br>
from Actions <br>
where action_date = '2019-07-04' and extra != 'None' <br>
group by extra,post_id) temp <br>
group by temp.extra; <br>
  
   </p>
