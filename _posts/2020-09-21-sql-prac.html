<body text="white">
<p>In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept others&#8217; requests as well.<br />
Table request_accepted holds the data of friend acceptance, while requester_id and accepter_id both are the id of a person.</p>
<pre class="example">
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date|
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
</pre>
<p>Write a query to find the the people who has most friends and the most friends number. For the sample data above, the result is:</p>
<pre class="example">
| id | num |
|----|-----|
| 3  | 3   |
</pre>

<p>Note:</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It is guaranteed there is only 1 people having the most friends.</li>
<li>The friend request could only been accepted once, which mean there is no multiple records with the same requester_id and accepter_id value.</li>
</ul>
<p>Explanation:<br />
The person with id &#8216;3&#8217; is a friend of people &#8216;1&#8217;, &#8216;2&#8217; and &#8216;4&#8217;, so he has 3 friends in total, which is the most number than any others.</p>

  <b> My solution <br>
  <a href="https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/gKWNAgnxNJsXUBLvy9pqxL/1">Db-fiddle for this problem</a> <br> </b> </p>

  <p style="color:yellow;"> The key intuition is to use 'union all' to merge the requester_id and accepter_id columns. </p>
  
  <p> 
SELECT a.id, count(a.id) num <br>
FROM <br>
    ( <br>
        (SELECT requester_id id FROM request_accepted) <br>
            UNION ALL <br>
        (SELECT accepter_id id FROM request_accepted) <br>
    ) a <br>
group by a.id <br>
order by count(a.id) DESC <br>
limit 1 <br>
   </p>
